Utilizing fundamental knowledge, we understand that the solution to inverse cosine zero requires determining the angle whose cosine equals zero. Are you currently familiar with the unit circle definition used universally for calculations of this type? The principal value for the arccosine function, often denoted as cos⁡−1(x) , is usually restricted to the interval running from zero to pi radians. Within this specific domain, what single unique value provides a cosine of exactly zero? The principal solution occurs at pi divided by two radians, which is numerically equivalent to ninety degrees. However, if we were pursuing general solutions outside the restricted principal range, would the full answer include terms such as n multiplied by pi, where n represents an integer? It is crucial that you understand the difference between the principal value solution and the full catalogue of general solutions, should your mathematics course demand the unusually broad explanation. The specific output for cos⁡−1(0) must be π2 radians unless otherwise specified by your instructor.
